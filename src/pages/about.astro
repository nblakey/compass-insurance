            <p>
                What sets us apart is simple: we know this market—and the people in it—far better than anyone you talk to on the other end of a 1-800 number.
                <br><br>Our founder, Gary Nolley, recognized that the senior market was underserved and that navigating Medicare could be overwhelming. With decades of industry experience, he built Compass to provide personalized guidance, ensuring clients feel confident and informed before and after every insurance decision. Today, Gary continues to mentor the next generation—his daughters Heather and Ashley—helping the team carry on the family’s commitment to trusted, expert service.
                <br><br>At Compass, our team combines extensive experience and local knowledge across a broad range of products, including Medicare, ACA Marketplace plans, life insurance, long-term care coverage, and retirement planning through annuities. Whether you're looking to roll a 401(k), pension, or CD into an annuity or exploring your insurance options, our agents are here to guide you with clarity, patience, and care.
                <br><br>More than just insurance, Compass is about people. Our agents bring personal attention, expertise, and a passion for helping clients make informed choices. We're proud to serve our neighbors in Central Indiana—not as a faceless call center, but as a trusted, family-run team who understands the market, the products, and, most importantly, you.
                <br><br>No matter the coverage you need, Compass Insurance Group is here to help you navigate the insurance maze with confidence.
