        <p>Learning more about the best type of Annuity that fits your needs is key in selection. Here is a summary of some of our annuities that we offer.</p>
        <div class="product-subheader">Immediate Annuity</div>
        <p>This is an insurance policy which, in exchange for a sum of money, guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments. These payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives, or even whichever is longer.</p>
        <div class="product-subheader">Index Annuity</div>
        <p>Indexed annuities usually provide a purchaser with various options for interest crediting. A buyer may choose a declared account option which functions the same as a traditional fixed annuity. However, the annuity also provides other options which consider the performance of an outside stock index (such as the Standard and Poorâ€™s 500, a.k.a. S&P 500) to determine interest.</p>
        <div class="product-subheader">Deferred Annuity</div>
        <p>All varieties of deferred annuities owned by individuals have one thing in common: any increase in account values is not taxed until those gains are withdrawn. This is also known as tax-deferred growth. A deferred annuity which grows by interest rate earnings alone is called a fixed deferred annuity (FA). A deferred annuity that permits allocations to stock or bond funds and for which the account value is not guaranteed to stay above the initial amount invested is called a variable annuity (VA).</p>
