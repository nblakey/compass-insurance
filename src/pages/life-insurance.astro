        <p>No one enjoys thinking about the tough choices surrounding death, but it is an important exercise in which we each must partake. Who will care for our family? Will they be stable financially? How will they afford funeral and other expenses?</p>
        <p>Life insurance products are available to answer these very questions.  A funeral now costs anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000 dollars. Not many of us have the money to pay for these expenses. Still, even fewer of us would want our family to expend that money for these costs rather than providing them with additional funds to pay down a mortgage you leave behind or other bills.</p>
        <p>There are myriad life insurance options. The value of the policies is just one decision to make. There are also several different types of policies, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Term Life</li>
            <li>Whole Life</li>
            <li>Universal Life</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our agents can help you understand the different options and find the coverage amount that is right for you. Life insurance is a major decision which will affect your entire family, so we want to ensure you make an informed decision with your family in mind and involved.</p>
