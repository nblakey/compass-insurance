            <p>Document Last Modified: April 8, 2025</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Compass Insurance Group (Compass) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users of this Web site (each, a “User”).</p>
            <p>Users’ privacy is very important to Compass. Compass is committed to safeguarding the information Users entrust to Compass. This Web site is appropriate for all ages.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">The Information We Collect</div>
            <p>Compass may collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways, including online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where Users are invited to volunteer such information. Compass may also collect information about how Users use our Web site, for example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the pages of the Web site, the type of computer used, or the domains from which Users originate. We may use “cookies” to track how Users use our Web site. A cookie is a piece of software code that a Web server can store on the Users’ PC and use to identify the User should they visit the Web site again. While not all of the information that we collect from Users is personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that Users provide us through our Web site. This information allows us to serve you more effectively and efficiently.</p>    
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">How We Use Information</div>    
            <p>Compass may use personally identifiable information collected through our Web site to contact Users regarding products and services offered by Compass and its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners, and otherwise to enhance Users’ experience with Compass and such affiliates, independent contractors and business partners. Compass may also use information collected through our Web site for research regarding the effectiveness of the Web site and the marketing, advertising and sales efforts of Compass, its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners.</p>
            <p>By submitting your email address at the Site, you agree to receive email marketing materials from us. We may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If you wish to end your email subscription to a particular list, you must follow the instructions contained in each email correspondence that you receive from us. Please follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list.</p>
            <p>To unsubscribe from all of our email lists, please follow the instructions set forth in the “Unsubscribe/Opt-Out” section below. We only send email marketing to individuals who have agreed to receive email from us.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Disclosure Of Information</div>
            <p>Compass may disclose information collected from Users to trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners who will use the information for the purposes outlined above. We may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from Users to investors and potential partners. We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, when legal process is served on our Site, if our assets are sold or acquired, or if our company is sold or acquired, or when we otherwise deem it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to this statement, you consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Maintenance Of Information</div>
            <p>Information about Users that is maintained on our systems is protected using industry standard security measures. However, we cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.</p> 
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Data Collection Practices By Third Party Advertisers And Marketers</div>
            <p>You can access certain third-party websites through our Site. When you opt to enter into a transaction with, receive information from or provide information to such third parties, you may be doing so through the third party. These third party associated websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and we assume no responsibility relating to them.</p>
            <p>We do not endorse, nor are we liable for the accuracy of, the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of each of the third-party organizations or their websites. Entities that may advertise, promote goods or services, and/or place banner ads at the Site, including these third-party organizations, are independent third parties and are not affiliated with us.</p>
            <p>You should read the privacy policies of such third-party websites to make sure that you agree to their terms before using such websites. If you wish to opt out of receiving mailings from such third-party advertisers and/or marketers, you must do so directly with such third party, or as otherwise provided on or through their respective websites</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Right To Contact Via Telephone</div>
            <p>In addition, by registering at this Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR Sec. 310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, we reserve the right to contact you via telemarketing under the Rule, and we may transfer this right to our sponsors and one or more third party marketing partners.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Group Aggregate Data</div>
            <p>We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about our Site users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage, or characteristics of our Site users as a group, without disclosing their personal information.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Security</div>
            <p>We endeavor to safeguard and protect our users’ information. When users submit information at this Site, such information is protected both online and offline. The servers in which we store our users’ personal information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control.</p>
            <p>All confidential, proprietary, and private data collected at Intulse.com is done so with the use of secure servers. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all payment information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. We may provide links to Third Party Providers’ sites that may request additional information from you, but we do not accept any liability for the security of credit card or other data transmitted to such third parties.</p>
            <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Children’s Privacy</div>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</div>
            <p>If you wish to access, delete or correct the information that you have provided to us through this Site, please contact us through the Contact Us section of our Site, via email or through written request to the Marketing Department at the address listed below. We may take reasonable steps to confirm the identity of the consumer in an effort to prevent identity theft.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Information From Integrated 3rd-Party Software</div>
            <p>We realize the data stored in 3rd-party can be very sensitive. Should you choose to integrate your Compass software with any 3rd-party software Compass will only access the minimal amount of information necessary to make the features of the integration work correctly. This usually includes, but is not limited to, names, IDs, and phone numbers. Compass does not save and store any sensitive information from 3rd-party software. Compass employees cannot and will not access and/or share any data stored in integrated 3rd-party software including, but not limited to, social security numbers, bank account numbers, investment account numbers, birth dates, address history, and criminal history.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Unsubscribe/Opt-Out</div>
            <p>To stop receiving future commercial communications directly from us, please Click Here and enter your email address in our unsubscribe system. Please note, however, that when you select this option, we will still send you emails and other communications regarding the Program and/or any transactions that you entered into by and through the Site for as long as you are a Member.</p>
            <p>We may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If you wish to end your email subscription from a particular list, you need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all of our email lists, you can call or send a written request to our Marketing Department at the following address:</p>
            <p>Compass Insurance Group<br>103 W Boggstown Rd.<br>Shelbyville, IN 46176<br>317.398.9321</p>
            <p>We process all unsubscribe/opt-out requests promptly, but it may take 48 hours for the change to be fully effective. Unsubscribing from one list may not remove the consumer from all marketing lists. Similarly, unsubscribing from one advertiser will not prevent the consumer from receiving all advertisers’ emails.</p>
            <p>Because third parties maintain their own unsubscribe/opt-out lists, email recipients who wish to end their email subscription from a particular third party must follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from that specific list. We do not control third party mailing lists and cannot process unsubscribe/opt-out requests if the message does not come directly from us.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Policy Changes</div>
            <p>We do update our policy from time to time without notice so please check back periodically. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this Site and the effective date of the policy will be modified to reflect the effective date of the most recent version.</p>
            <div class="product-subheader !text-left">Questions</div>
